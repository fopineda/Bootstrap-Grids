col-xs-*      <--- Will not stack
col-sm-*      <--- Will stack once the screen size gets small enough
col-md-*      <--- Will stack once the screen size gets small enough ()
col-lg-*      <--- Will stack once the screen size gets small enough (It will appear stacked on laptops, this size for huge screens)


On the larger column sizes, the columns will stack only on are larger screens.
So for example, if I am using my 13 inch macbook pro, and I give it a column size of col-lg-*, the columns will be already stacked whenever I refresh.
It will only be horizontal if your screen is HUGE.
